## Milestone 1 Velocity
* Iteration 1 expected velocity: 6 * 5 * 2 * .5 = 30 hours an iteration
* US1 - 15 hrs, US2 - 13 hrs: 28
* actual hours worked a day: 5, 6 members: first iteration: 150 
* Iteration 1 real velocity: 30/150 = .2


* Iteration 2 expected velocity: 6 * 7 * 7 * .2 = 58.8 hours an iteration
* US3 - 7 hrs, US4 - 5 hrs US5 - 10 hrs, US6 - 5 hrs
* actual hours worked a day: 7, 6 members: second iteration: 294
* Iteration 2 real velocity: 27/294 = .09

## Milestone 2 Velocity
* Iteration 1 expected velocity: 6 people * 7 days * 4 hours/day * 0.4 expected velocity = 67.2 hours an iteration
* Iteration 1 Work: US1 - 17 hrs, US2 - 12 hrs, US4 - 11 hrs, DS1 - 4 hrs: 44 total hours
* Actual hours worked a day: 6 people * 7 days * 5 hours/day = 168 hours
* Iteration 1 real velocity: 44/168 = 0.26


* Iteration 2 expected velocity: 6 people * 7 days * 5 hours/day * 0.26 expected velocity = 54.6 hours an iteration
* Iteration 2 Work: US3 - 9 hrs, US 5 - 5 hrs, US6 - 10 hrs, US7 - 5 hrs, US8 - 6 hrs, US9 - 5 hrs, DS2 - 4 hrs, DS3 - 8 hrs: 52 total hours
* Actual hours worked a day: 6 people * 7 days * 5 hours/day = 210 hours
* Iteration 1 real velocity: 52/210 = 0.25
